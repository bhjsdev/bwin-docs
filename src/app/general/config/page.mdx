# Configuration

Binary Window organizes panes using a binary tree structureâ€”hence the name **Binary Window**.

## Concept

Internally, Binary Window uses a binary tree to organize its panes. Each node in this tree is called a **sash** (a container of panes).

- If a sash has no children, it renders a **pane**.
- If a sash has children, it renders a **muntin** (a vertical or horizontal divider) for its child nodes.

## Config Node

Each config node corresponds a sash.

### No Children

Consider following example:

```json
{
  "position": "left",
  "size": 200,
  "content": "Pane content"
}
```

Because this node does not have children, it renders a pane.

- The `position` property determines the pane's position relative to its parent. Valid values include `left`, `right`, `top`, `bottom`.

- The `size` property determines the pane's dimension (width if `left` or `right`, and height if `top` or `bottom`).

- The `content` property determines what is rendered inside the pane (e.g., text, a HTML element or a React component)

### With Children

By design, each node can have at most two children. Consider following example:

```json
{
  "position": "left",
  "size": 200,
  "children": [
    {
      "position": "top",
      "size": 0.4,
      "content": "Top pane content"
    },
    {
      "position": "bottom",
      "size": "60%",
      "content": "Bottom pane content"
    }
  ]
}
```

Since this node has children, it renders a muntin (a draggable divider between panes).

- The `size` property determines the total size of its children. Depending on the value of `position`, the size can be the width (if `left` or `right`) or height (if `top` or `bottom`).

- Each child can use a numeric fraction (e.g., 0.4) or a string with a percentage (e.g., "60%") to indicate how much of the total size it occupies. A fraction like 0.4 translates to 40%, and "60%" explicitly denotes 60%.

- In this example, the first child (with a position of `top`) takes 40% of 200 (i.e., 80px) in height, while the bottom child takes 60% of 200 (i.e., 120px) in height.

It is also possible to omit one child node. If omitted, Binary Window infers the missing child's position and size. For instance:

```json
{
  "position": "left",
  "size": 200,
  "children": [
    {
      "position": "top",
      "size": 0.4,
      "content": "Top pane content"
    }
  ]
}
```

Here, because we specified a top pane as the only one child, the system automatically infers a bottom pane to fill the remaining space.

### Root Config Node

The root config node represents the **window** itself. It carries the same properties as a config node, plus a few additional ones. For example:

```json
{
  "width": 400,
  "height": 300,
  "content": "Single pane content"
}
```

- The `width` and `height` properties determine the overall window size.
- If the window has no children, it simply renders a single pane using the `content` property.

In many cases, you may want the window to automatically fit its container. Set `fitContainer` to `true` to achieve this:

```json
{
  "fitContainer": true,
  "children": ...
}
```

With `fitContainer` set, the window will resize to match its parent container.

### Putting it All Together

Because of Binary Window's inference features, many properties can be omitted. Below is an example of a multi-pane layout:

```json
{
  "width": 400,
  "height": 300,
  "children": [
    { "position": "left", "size": 200, "content": "Left pane content" },
    {
      "children": [
        { "position": "top", "size": 0.4, "content": "Top right pane content" },
        { "content": "Bottom right pane content" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

In React, the code below is equivalent, using the `Window` component's `panes` prop (instead of children, to avoid conflicts with React's children):

```jsx
<Window
  width={400}
  height={300}
  panes={[
    {
      position: 'left',
      size: 200,
      content: 'Left pane content',
    },
    {
      children: [
        {
          position: 'top',
          size: '40%',
          content: 'Top right pane content',
        },
        {
          content: 'Bottom right pane content',
        },
      ],
    },
  ]}
/>
```
